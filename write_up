Homework 5-

I think I completed this assignment 100%, all of the test cases seem to work.

Writing the overflow case was pretty simple, the hardest part was getting 
the generic print string function to work, which I called “prints”. 

Writing the normal case without overflow was much more difficult. 
I used the stack to store each remainder as soon as they were calculated by DIV. 
and then I just read them back off the stack to print to the screen.
